## HINTS FOR SOLUTION DERIVATION

- The 'U' character in the maze representation likely marks the starting point
- The maze appears to require zigzag navigation following walls
- The pattern "dwaw" (down, up, left, up) appears frequently in successful patterns
- Alternating movement directions is likely key to finding the correct path
- The most promising patterns have a balance of all four movement directions
- Longer sequences with regular patterns have higher chances of success

Remember to run these in a Linux environment as the binary is an ELF executable.
When you find the correct sequence, you'll receive the flag message:
"You're out, here's your flag: [FLAG]"
