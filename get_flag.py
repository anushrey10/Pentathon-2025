'''
This script provides the most likely solutions for the quagmire challenge.
Since we can't run the Linux binary directly on macOS, you'll need to try
these sequences in an environment where you can run the binary (such as a Linux VM
or through a remote connection).

Instructions:
1. Run the binary: ./glade
2. When prompted for moves, enter one of the sequences below
3. If you get the flag, congratulations! If not, try the next sequence.
