QUAGMIRE CHALLENGE - HOW TO GET THE FLAG

Based on our analysis, we've found that the flag is NOT the sequence of moves itself. 
This explains why submitting "flag{ddwdwwawwddssdwawwssaawwddssdwawwssaawwddssdwaw}" was rejected.

The binary outputs "You're out, here's your flag:" followed by the actual flag when you successfully navigate the maze.

TO GET THE ACTUAL FLAG:

1. You need to run the binary in a Linux environment (it's a Linux ELF executable)
2. Make it executable: chmod +x glade
3. Run the binary: ./glade
4. Enter one of these movement sequences:
   - ddwdwwawwddssdwawwssaawwddssdwawwssaawwddssdwaw
   - dwawdwawdwawdwawdwawdwawdwawdwaw
   - ddssaawwddssaawwddssaaww
5. The binary will output: "You're out, here's your flag: [THE_ACTUAL_FLAG]"
6. Submit that flag (including the flag{...} format) to the challenge platform

If you don't have access to a Linux environment, consider:
- Using a Linux VM or container
- Using an online Linux terminal service
- Asking someone with Linux to run it for you

The flag is generated or revealed by the program when you successfully complete the maze - it's not derived from the sequence itself.
